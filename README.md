# Assignment 3 - The Book Corner: Online Book Shop (Shop Owner / Employee Site)

## A) Summary 
- The goal of this project is to create an online e-commerce shop which sells books
- Create a management system for the shop’s owner / employees to perform CRUD operations on books, customer orders and related data
- Deployed URL: https://tgc-dl-the-book-corner.herokuapp.com/


## B) UI / UX
- User Stories (Shop Owner / Employees)
    1. As a shop owner / manager / employee, I want to view the available books and their related information I have in the database so that I can prepare reports / advise customers etc.
    2. As a shop owner / manager, I want to add new books and their related information so that I can provide more books to customers / make more money.
    3. As a shop owner / manager, I want to update the information about books and their related information e.g. tags , so that I can correct mistakes / update cover art / ensure the most updated information is provided to customers
    4. As a shop owner / manager, I want to delete books and their related information so that I can remove unavailable books from the database.
    5. As a shop owner / manager / employee, I want to filter books by title and other criteria so that I can view / update / delete a specific book easily.
    6. As a shop owner, I want to create new users and limit the functions available to them based on the role I assign them so that more employees can access the website while still maintaining control.
    7. As shop owner, I want my employees to be able to log in / out of the site so that all information in the database can only be accessed by those with a valid username / password.

- Choice of colour and fonts
    - Sans Serif font as it is easy to read 
    - Dark Navbar against a white background makes the text based information easy for the user to absorb and stands out to the user
    - Table format used to organise information makes it easy to contain alot of information in a organized and compact space
